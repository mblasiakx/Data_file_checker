1. **Lyon’s financial situation is poor:** They have been demoted to Ligue 2 due to their financial difficulties.
2. **The DNGC imposed a punishment:** The DNGC, the club’s financial oversight body, decided to demote them to Ligue 2.
3. **The punishment is due to Uefa rules:** These rules prevent multiple teams under one ownership structure from competing in the same European competition.
4. **The DNGC’s decision was “incomprehensible”**: This suggests the DNGC didn’t believe Lyon could improve its finances enough to avoid the punishment.
5. **The DNGC’s intervention failed**: Lyon officials met with the DNGC and didn’t convince them to lift the punishment.

Therefore, Lyon has been relegated because of the DNGC’s decision, which was deemed incomprehensible and ultimately, unsuccessful in resolving their financial problems.

**Answer:** Lyon has been relegated because of the DNGC’s decision, which was deemed incomprehensible and unsuccessful in resolving their financial problems.",Lyon has not been relegated because of bad finacial condition.,0.8666666666666667,0.9265734460957158,0.0,0.0
