Why Lyon has been relegated?

1. **Lyon’s Financial Trouble:** Lyon’s finances are severely strained due to substantial debts (£422m).
2. **DNGC Decision:** The DNGC (the body overseeing club accounts) deemed the situation “incomprehensible” and confirmed a demotion.
3. **Relegation Due to Uefa Rules:** This demotion is a direct result of Uefa rules that prevent multiple clubs under one ownership structure from competing in the same European competition.
4. **Previous Demotion:** Lyon was provisionally demoted by the DNGC in November.
5. **Lack of Improvement:** Lyon officials didn’t convince the DNGC that their situation had improved enough to avoid the punishment.

Therefore, Lyon has been relegated because of its poor financial situation, which is a consequence of failing to meet the requirements set by Uefa rules.

**Answer:** Lyon has been relegated because of its financial problems, which led to the DNGC deciding on a demotion.
