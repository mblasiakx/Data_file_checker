1. **Lyon’s financial problems:** Lyon is demoted to Ligue 2 due to poor financial condition.
2. **DNGC’s decision:** The DNGC (the body overseeing club accounts) decided to demote them.
3. **Uefa rules:** These rules prevent multiple clubs under one ownership structure from competing in the same European competition.
