Here’s a breakdown:

*   **Champions League:** This is the premier club competition in Europe, featuring the top teams from various leagues across the continent. It’s known for its higher level of competition and more frequent, dramatic results.
*   **European Cup:** This was the original European club competition, which was rebranded into the Champions League in 1992. It was a predecessor to the Champions League.

Essentially, the Champions League is the modern, higher-stakes version, while the European Cup was the older, less competitive competition.

**Note:** The European Cup has been renamed to the Champions League, and its competitions have been changed to the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League.
